 dMRI data that I always use



The `aperiodic_pincat.mat` and `invivo_perfusion.mat`  is the cardiac data that the paper `k-t SLR` uses

Lingala, Sajan Goud, et al. "Accelerated dynamic MRI exploiting sparsity and low-rank structure: kt SLR." *IEEE transactions on medical imaging* 30.5 (2011): 1042-1054.



The `data_tmi.mat` and the `data_tmi_fast.mat` is the same cardiac data divided into a standard version and a fast version, but I don't know which paper uses this data.



The `breathing.mat` is a breathing cardiac cine MRI data, and is not known where it comes from.
